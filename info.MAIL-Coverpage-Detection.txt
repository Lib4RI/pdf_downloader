Hello Together

Thanks for reminding me this PDF download project (4 years ago).
It will (hopefully) be now a little bit more ‘straight-forward’, although also now some human interactions will probably be required within the entire task.

A former remark stated that the size of the cover page (resp. page 1) alone is only a very vague criteria.
The publisher and looking for a preset pattern of words/terms were better criterias.

For example https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2011/CC/c1cc12490k
There is a 'Downloaded by' notation in a very low amount of words, there is also the sequnece 'View Article Online', 'Journal Homepage', 'Table of Contents for this issue'.
This seem to be a good indication of a cover page - of course we have to re-/post-check it manually what was cut off.


So perhaps we should proceed like this:
1.)
	Downloading as many PDFs a possible.
	Per PDF storing some metadata (DORA PID, publisher, DOI, ...) in file.

2.)
	Cloning page 1 of each PDF and extracing its text
	Manually setting up (better) patterns to identify a cover page.
	Repeating this step until we have (per publisher probably) satisfing patterns where to cut off page 1.
	
3.)	
	Cutting off an assumed cover page and uploading each PDFs to its PID into DORA.


Some improvment of the approach may be needed, for example:
- About 1.) - There are 46 publications with a WoS ID only, and 329 with a Scopus ID only - how/when to deal with them?
- About 1.) - Each PDF may have metadata in its file header - drop it or maintain it?
- About 2.) - Re-tuning patterns may become more and more painful, so a 'page-1-keep/drop' special-case-list with PIDs may be more useful.
- About 2.) - Generally this step will be work-intensive, so big page-1-thumbnails may help (Windows-PDF-Preview may be too small/lame).
- About 3.) - In theory all PDF-derivatives could be pre-produced for less system stress - not sure though if DORA will like 'fremd-ingested' derivatives.
- About 3.) - If the cover page detection in 2.) has expected/known lacks, we need a last recheck/postfix here.
